        <h2>Ketevan Alavidze</h2>
        <p>At a very early age, I started getting a taste of the wide range of things that Georgis has to offer to travelers.
After living and travelling around many countries,  I decided that it was about time to settle down in my beloved country and start a project which would allow me to combine my two passions: human relations and travel. And this is how Nomad Travel was created.      
            I love listening to my clients, empathize with them, put myself in their shoes, and take wonderful care of them. But I also love getting to know our guides, our artisans, our drivers…So, in the end, when you know both sides, you can perfectly match them and it turns out to be ALL ABOUT PEOPLE.</p>

            <p>My passion for travel, made me make the decision to obtain my degree in tourism and hotel management, to later become an expert travel agent in Georgia.
                After traveling to different countries and having the opportunity to live in the United States and Ireland while developing my professional career, I decided to return to Georgia to undertake a new and exciting challenge in the world of receptive tourism. I joined my experience, my passion for my work, my willingness to show others the best of my country and I joined the NomadTravel project, turning my passion into my profession.               
                Traveling is my biggest passion, and my goal it is to customize unforgettable trips.</p>
